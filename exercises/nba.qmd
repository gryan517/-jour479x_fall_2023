```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(hoopR)
```

```{r}
lineups <- nba_teamdashlineups(team_id = 1610612752)[[2]]
```

```{r}
lineups <- lineups |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("GP"):ncol(lineups), as.numeric))
```
```{r}
lineups |>
  filter(!str_detect(GROUP_NAME, "Barrett")) |>
  select(GROUP_NAME, GP, MIN, PLUS_MINUS)|>
  arrange(desc(PLUS_MINUS))
```
My takeaway is that Barrett is among the highest played and most successful lineup played. Barrett is a significant component to consistently high and positive lineups.
